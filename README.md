# A-B-testing-Twitter-ad.
Twitter offers a platform for businesses to create advertising campaigns aimed at increasing brand awareness and product adoption. Advertisers set a budget for their campaigns, and they are only charged for actual clicks on their ads. However, a delay between ad serving and click reporting can lead to overspending, where advertisers are billed for clicks exceeding their budget. For instance, if a campaign has $10 left and generates clicks worth $20, $10 is considered wasted.

Recently, Twitter has noticed an increase in overspending and decided to test a new ad product where advertisers pay for ad impressions rather than clicks, aiming to reduce latency in billing. To evaluate this new product, an A/B test was conducted, splitting advertisers into two groups: one using the traditional click-based model and the other using the impression-based model. After a week, Twitter aims to analyze the data to determine the success of the experiment.
